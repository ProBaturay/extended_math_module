# Extended Math Module
An alternative module to the original math library provided by Roblox. The original library permits you to access functions and numbers directly, but the reason this successor exists is that it gets complicated by adding new methods and constants in math library. Therefore, some mathematical terms may interchange meanings from one another. This is where the library is overhauled, also with typechecking!
